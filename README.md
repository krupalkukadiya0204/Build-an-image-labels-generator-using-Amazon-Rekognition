# Build-an-image-labels-generator-using-Amazon-Rekognition

This project is an Image Labels Generator that utilizes Amazon Rekognition for image analysis and AWS CLI for automation. The tool enables you to upload images to AWS, analyze them using Rekognition's powerful machine learning models, and extract key labels such as objects, scenes, and activities.

### Features
Amazon Rekognition Integration: Automatically detects objects, scenes, and activities in images using Amazon's machine learning service.

AWS CLI Automation: Seamless interaction with AWS services through command-line tools for uploading images and retrieving label data.

Scalable Design: Supports single image uploads or batch processing, making it ideal for a wide range of use cases.

Efficient Labeling: Quickly and accurately generates labels for various types of images, allowing for easy organization and further processing.


### Requirements
AWS CLI installed and configured

AWS Account with Amazon Rekognition service enabled

Python 3.x (Optional for additional scripting)

### Installation
Install the AWS CLI: pip install awscli

Configure AWS CLI with your credentials: aws configure
